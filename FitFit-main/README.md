# Ensuring Securing in CPS for Healthcare Applications

This project aims to secure Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) edge nodes by integrating various communication technologies and applying security measures. As part of the project, we are working with ESP32 modules, which are connected via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to communicate with other devices and ensure secure data transmission.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the security of edge nodes in a CPS environment. These nodes are typically responsible for collecting and transmitting data between physical systems and digital systems. By integrating various communication protocols such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, we aim to ensure secure communication channels and prevent unauthorized access.

### Current Progress:

- Successfully connected ESP32 devices via **Bluetooth** and **Wi-Fi**.
- Verified communication between the devices, ensuring seamless connectivity.
- Identified potential vulnerabilities in the current setup and proposed mitigation strategies.

### Next Steps:

- Implement advanced security features such as encryption and authentication for communication protocols.
- Conduct penetration testing to simulate potential attacks and assess the system's security.
- Finalize the design of the security model for CPS edge nodes and document best practices for securing them.

## Installation

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Requirements:

- ESP32 development board
- Arduino IDE (for programming the ESP32)
- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled devices
- Basic knowledge of embedded systems and network security

### Setup:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhinavan2004/Ensuring-Securing-in-CPS-for-Healthcare-Applications
2.  **Install Dependencies:**

Install necessary libraries for ESP32 Bluetooth and Wi-Fi communication.
Ensure the Arduino IDE is set up with the ESP32 board package.

3. **Upload the Code:**

Open the project in Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board (ESP32). Upload the code to the ESP32 board.

4.  **Testing the Connection:**

Ensure that the ESP32 can successfully connect to both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Check serial output for status messages.
